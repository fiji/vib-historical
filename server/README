Server plan:

   Two backend systems:

       1 Java VM, running ImageJ jobs
       Another server for normal processes






Load a page.  If the page might require some job to generate data for it, 


 that requires some job.  What happens?


  - Insert into the jobs table some row with:

       id, type (java or process), what_to_run, percent_done, last_estimated_completion_time, completed

  - Start it.  The process / JVM gets passed the ID.
